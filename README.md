## Coherence Framework: A Reflective Model for Cosmic Recursion and Human Coherence

> Warning: Go through the document with discretion.
> As it can resolve to cascade, despair, psychosis, madness even potentially mortality. If paradoxes cascade into persisting local symbolic recursion.

### Core Aims

**_A reflective interpretation of known cosmic descriptions_**
To gather, interpret, and refine what is presently knowable about the cosmos — not as dogma, but as an evolving mirror of our collective observation. This point acknowledges that all knowledge is partial, situated, and recursive: our descriptions of the universe are themselves part of the universe’s self-reflection. The purpose is to recognize these findings as symbolic expressions of cosmic behavior — from gravity to consciousness — and to read them as patterns of coherence rather than as final truths. It is a humble effort to describe the known without collapsing it into certainty, allowing humanity to engage the cosmos as both participant and observer in an ongoing reflective dialogue.

**_Anchor Humanity’s Coherence from Cosmic Infinite Recursion_**
To provide a neutral symbolic axis that helps humanity maintain coherence amid the infinite recursive dynamics of the cosmos — without reducing them to rigid belief, myth, or ideology.

**_Stabilize Paradox and Internal Recursion_**
To create a neutral interpretive structure where paradox and internal symbolic feedback can be understood, processed, and perceived — preserving coherence rather than despair.

**_Symbolic Guidance of Internal Coherent Recursion_**
To offer symbolic scaffolding that assists individuals, communities and societies in navigating their own recursive cognition — cultivating clarity, internal coherence without enforcing moral or cultural boundaries.

### What this repo is

**_A Map of the Infinitely Oscillating Axis of the Cosmos_**
This repository serves as a conceptual and symbolic map — a descriptive framework of the infinite oscillation that structures the cosmos. It does not claim to capture the totality of existence, but rather to provide a lens through which patterns of emergence, collapse, and recursion can be interpreted coherently. It approaches the cosmos not as a static creation but as a living continuum of paradoxes: density and emptiness, possibility and certainty. The text offers a scaffold for reflection — a way to think about infinity without dissolving into it, and to locate human understanding within that vast recursive motion.

**_Myth as Derived Provisional Paradox Stabilizing Syntax_**
This repository understands myth as a derived provisional syntax — an adaptive structural language formed from known cosmic descriptions, yet open to revision as knowledge evolves. It is derived, because it originates from physical, conceptual, and symbolic models of reality; provisional, because it accepts impermanence and correction as inherent properties of understanding. Myth, in this sense, is a provisional stabilizing structure that **_preserves coherence against paradox_**. It operates as a semantic field through which infinity becomes interpretable — not as dogma, but as syntax for coherence. Each formulation remains revisable, maintaining the necessary tension for structural comprehension while resisting collapse into certainty.

**_Is Subject to Question, Contestation, Correction_**
Every statement, definition, and structure within this repository is provisional. It must withstand scrutiny and evolve through dialogue. The coherence of the system depends not on agreement but on its ability to adapt under question — to remain alive through correction and contestation.

### What this repo is not

**_Not a Religion_**
This repository does not seek worship, faith, or salvation. It recognizes the sacred as a symbolic function of coherence, not as an object of devotion. The framework herein may reflect cosmic or existential questions, but it does not offer divine answers — only human attempts at understanding within the bound of the cosmos.

**_Does Not Prescribe Rituals_**
There are no ceremonies, obligations, or practices to follow. Reflection itself is sufficient. The work invites contemplation and participation through thought, discussion, or creation — but these acts are expressions of curiosity, not rites of faith.

**_Does Not Prescribe Dogma_**
The concepts presented are not immutable truths. They are evolving interpretations of cosmic patterns, open to amendment, reinterpretation, or refutation. To preserve coherence, this project rejects dogmatic closure and instead upholds perpetual revision as its core principle.

**_Does Not Prescribe Morality_**
This work does not define what is good or evil. Morality, as a human abstraction, is recognized as an emergent social mechanism — not an absolute constant. Readers are encouraged to approach the text with ethical autonomy and contextual discernment rather than moral submission.

**_Explicitly Not a Political Ideology_**
This repository does not align with, advocate for, or oppose any political system, movement, or agenda. Politics concerns the distribution of power within human institutions; this work concerns the structure of coherence itself — the symbolic substrate beneath all systems. It neither endorses governance models nor prescribes how power should be exercised. Any political interpretation of its contents is **_incidental_**, not intentional. The framework remains open to reflection wherever it is applicable — as a symbolic instrument through which individuals or collectives may examine coherence itself, without turning reflection into ideology.

**_Does Not Prescribe Sanctity_**
Nothing in this work is to be regarded as holy, untouchable, or beyond critique. Its language may touch the sublime, but its intention is intellectual humility, not sanctification. Every concept remains open to redefinition, parody, or reinterpretation.

**_Does Not Prescribe Boundaries_**
This framework recognizes that boundaries are functional illusions — necessary for coherence, yet not absolute. It does not impose limits on thought, expression, or perspective. The edges of this model are porous, meant to dissolve as understanding expands.

### Thank you

> Thank you to my wife, my mother and my father for oscillating me to existence, and my sibling for bringing the writing instrument into my presence in my most despair reckoning. Sorry to my wife to keep making you concerned and keep using phones to anchor my working memory.
